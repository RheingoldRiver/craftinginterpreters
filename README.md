This is my fork-but-I-unforked of the [Crafting Interpreters repo](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters). I'm editing the files in [java/com/craftinginterpreters/lox](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/java/com/craftinginterpreters/lox) a bit to extend the Lox language as suggested by some of the challenges in the book / as I want to. Everything will be done as pull requests with commit messages so look there if you want to see what I did.
